Sample Scripts from Iron Valiant Game

These are some scripts from an upcoming Mech Shooter game.

Some of the functionality from the "Lothair" script is ommitted due to ownership issues.

The scripts give a good idea of how the "mechbase" and "Lothair" scripts work.

The lothair script does not contain attack logic as it can be modified per use.
